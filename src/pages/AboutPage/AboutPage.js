          Iâ€™m currently in my 5th year as software engineer doing full-stack development for Modernizing Medicine in Boca Raton, Florida. Prior to this job, I was doing development for J.P.Morgan. Chase & Co. in Tampa, Florida. I definitely prefer Florida's east coast over its west coast.

          I work a lot with Java (Spring) and MySQL, as well as HTML/CSS/JavaScript (AngularJS/Angular). More recently, I've picked up learning React; this website is my first project with the library.

          I've always had a keen eye for UX/UI and really want to get deeper into frontend development. When given the opportunity to work on the frontend, I always feel a spark of empowerment and creativity.

          When I'm not coding, you can find me swim/bike/run training for a triathlon, hosting my podcast, The Triathlete Beat, or enjoying some delicious craft beers from around the world. Cheers!
