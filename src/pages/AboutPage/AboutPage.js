          Iâ€™m currently in my 5th year as software engineer doing full-stack development for Modernizing Medicine in Boca Raton, Florida. Prior to this job, I was doing development for J.P.Morgan. Chase & Co. in Tampa, Florida. I definitely prefer swimming in Florida's east coast beaches over its west coast beaches!

          I work a lot with Java (Spring) and MySQL, as well as HTML/CSS/JavaScript (AngularJS/Angular). More recently, I've picked up learning React; this site is my first project with the library.

          I've always had a keen eye for UX/UI and really want to get deeper into frontend development. When working on the frontend, I always feel a spark of empowerment and creativity.

          When I'm not coding, you can find me swim/bike/run training for my next triathlon, hosting my podcast, The Triathlete Beat, or enjoying some delicious craft beers from around the world. Please feel free to check out some of my adventures at the links below. Cheers!
